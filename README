This application is a generator, capable of randomly producing full-fledged
dungeons and mazes for D&D, 3rd edition. It includes a CGI
front-end, as well as a command-line front-end that is suitable only for
generating mazes (though is quite powerful for all of that).

BUILDING
--------

This library was written well before I knew anything about autoconf and
friends. Thus, the makefile should be considered to be only a guideline, and
you're expected to actually MUCK WITH IT. Yes, I know. How deliciously
primitive.

You should set the CFLAGS environment variable to the locations of the
following header files:

* dnd-writetem (a library hosted at this site)
* dnd-util (a library hosted at this site)
* dnd-npc (a library hosted at this site)
* qDecoder (http://www.qDecoder.org)
* gd2 (http://www.boutell.com/gd/)

You should also set the LDFLAGS environment variable to the locations of the
library (*.a) files for each of the above as well.
